07/20/2024,1,"This seller only sent 1 filter of a 2 pack that was ordered! This order was for new filters! The 1 filter received had the box taped up and when tested, was 5 times dirtier than the filter I was replacing! This seller is sending out used filters and selling them as new! I will never place another order from this seller again!"
08/11/2024,5,"Oh, Yes!! This Revlon lipstick is The Perfect Shade! It is Creamy and the color is Long Lasting!! The Price was Very Reasonable!!"
07/15/2024,5,I love this shampoo - feels  great on my hair and has a nice smell.
07/15/2024,5,"The seller ships promptly, and products are well-packaged and protected."
03/09/2024,5,"It took longer to receive the towels than I expected, but they were worth the wait."
02/29/2024,5,These were the right size that I needed at a good price.
02/24/2024,1,You did not advertise that the item was two years expired !!!!!!!
02/16/2024,4,i don't like it -- old and will be expired in less then 6 months
12/29/2023,5,Delivery was fast and package was in perfect shape.
12/21/2023,5,The bath towels were packaged nicely and shipped and received on the date promised. Thank you.
10/18/2023,1,"for a size small it was extremely too large .  even for myself , a size ex it was too big, especially the sleeves."
08/01/2023,1,I ordered a white garden hose reel. You sent me a black one with black hose which will kill plants from hot water. Walmart and your supplier have said they will correct this have done nothing in over 2 weeks since I ordered it. Why no communication or return. STILL WAITING..... HELLO...
11/21/2023,5,"Got exactly what was advertised, smooth service and good product"
11/16/2023,5,Love these pillows.  Have been using them for years.  Not too soft and not hard!!
11/03/2023,5,my dogs like this treat.  I hope it keeps their teeth clean.
10/29/2023,1,It was apparently IME that substituted the discontinued coffee maker on my order.
10/14/2023,1,Poor sewing and excess purple dye and lint in the dryer filter and even on my floors.
09/17/2022,1,The seller said it was delivered to the mailbox.  I’m pretty sure we would have noticed a 38 lb bag of bog food in our box.  In other words they never sent it.  Customer service for Walmart.com is horrible.
06/19/2022,5,"Like every thing that’s good, it’s a lot more expensive than sugar unless you factor what sugar damage does to your body and the eventual medical bills to follow that damage."
06/15/2022,1,Horrible shipping and service. I tried to give them a second chance and the product never showed up. Delivery dates kept getting pushed back further and further which means another round of spoiled product
05/25/2023,4,"Bars arrived melted, but that is more on the weather and the time of day that they arrived.  No issues otherwise."
05/19/2023,1,"food received warm due to poor packaging. 
IME used 1 small ice pack, which was defrosted. will not buy from this seller again."
02/14/2023,3,These crisps arrived in a timely manner but were so stale and old that I had to throw them out. Yuck.
06/15/2022,1,"Walmart does not know how to package this product. The glass jars broke. Again. I got a soggy, moldy box in the mail. Again. Don’t take the chance."
03/21/2022,5,"LLC I don't know what this is

You don'list it but I bought an expensive chuck roast which was terrible"
04/17/2023,2,"Pick another terry robe,something softer.
Delivery time was excellent."
11/09/2022,5,One scoop makes for a great cup of coffee. I like mine hot.
10/05/2022,5,"Use them before they go bad, refrigerate after opening"
09/09/2022,5,I am always happy with my service and my products I buy........
07/13/2022,5,"Received on expected day, behich was quicker than the main competitor"
06/10/2022,3,I asked for the spoiled one to be replaced. Haven't heard from them yet.
04/06/2022,1,Never got my Oder. What a bunch of BS And nobody got back with me.
02/22/2022,1,"Over priced, sent incorrectly,  package tampered with before I recieved."
01/04/2022,5,These are healthy and taste amazing.  A little pricey but I understand why.
11/04/2021,1,Popcorn was great. The 3 week wait for delivery after ordering was terrible.
09/15/2021,1,Item ordered is great but it was never delivered. Walmart.com is the worst!!!
05/04/2019,5,Seller was fabulous...will be ordering from them again...
